## Schedule and Plans
- Early January
  - Review machine learning fundamentals, seek applications in chatbot and chat inputs
  - Finalize starter front-end for interfacing with Python script
- Mid-Jan
  - User starts with a competent but banal chatbot
  - Uploads personal logs to create personality
  - Can refine and train that personality, or give custom personality choices

## Current Objectives
1. Source public chatlog data
2. Decision on algorithims to create initial bot
